# Build build/pv through ps3gfx's preview: the library's tools/preview/build.zsh
# compiles this app's source/ and tools/preview/pv_app.c (the drive, 383, 409,
# the SPUs) with the library's own sources, against its stub headers plus this
# folder's stub/ (sys/spu.h, lv2/spu.h, and pv_health.h, force-included: the
# declarations the library's headers lack). The checkout is $PS3GFX, else
# $PS3DEV/src/ps3gfx, the clone sdk_setup.sh makes at the pinned commit; a
# checkout at another commit is announced, since the pkg links the pin.
